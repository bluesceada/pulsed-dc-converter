12-20V DC to Pulsed DC Converter

Transforms 12-20V DC to a kind of pulsed DC, compatible with some Power Tools using phase cutting
control (for example Proxxon Micromot), in the range up to around 40W.

Like that, with the respective Adapter, those small Power Tools can be operated from a USB C PD
Power Bank. Adapter Example: https://aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=power+adapter+usb+c+dc+20v

Progress:

 [x] Simple loop works on breadboard with similar schematic as in kicad
 
 [x] PCB designed and ordered
 
 [  ] PCB tested and working
 
 [  ] Use ADC feedback to increase the ON-time of the transistor to maximize power for powerbanks
