Measurements were on a 19V/12V Supply Voltage from a 65W USB-C Power Supply. Transistors IRLZ34N or RFP14NO5 were used (leading to very similar results). The analog measurements were done on the negative supply voltage of the power tool [1], which is the NMOS transistor's drain.

All measurements done with either a 10x analog probe or a 2x resistor-based voltage divider (because the measurement device range is +/- 10V only). The analog 10x probe is also connected through a long measurement line, and it is a rather cheap device [1]. Thus, do not trust the analog measurements too much. Please consider, they would also be somewhat different on a final PCB.
